## Movie App with TMDB API

### Today I made a movie app project with using javascript and scss. I used the TMDB API to pull the data.

### You can search by movie title or categories. If there is no movie suitable for the categories you have chosen, the text "No results found" appears on the screen. When we hover the movie, the movie's score and description appear. We click on the learn more button to find out more information.You can see the movie's features like budget, rating, release date, genres and length. Since the data all came from the api, some datas are given as 0 in some movies. You can watch the trailer of the movie. In the results of most movies, I added the first video as it is a trailer, but some may not have a trailer. If there is no video data from the API, the text "Video Not Found "appears.

### If we search with the categories selected, the selected categories are automatically reset. At the bottom of the page, there are pagination buttons. Depending on whether we are at the beginning or the end, the buttons are active or inactive. If there is only 1 page, both are disabled.
